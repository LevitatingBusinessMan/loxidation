All allocated values should probably be reference counted.
Like seen in the rc branch with the string value.

In Bobs spec, redeclaring a local should result in an error.
Redeclaring a global shouldn't.
Currently both don't error, I think I will keep it that way.

don't create duplicate constants?

look into the equality test

make repl keep it's state
(recompile the whole source with the new line, and then start the vm at it's old ip?)
