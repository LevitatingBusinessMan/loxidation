All allocated values should probably be reference counted.
Like seen in the rc branch with the string value.
Some could even be in a Cow?

In Bobs spec, redeclaring a local should result in an error.
Redeclaring a global shouldn't.
Currently both don't error, I think I will keep it that way.

don't create duplicate constants?

look into the equality test

make repl keep it's state
(recompile the whole source with the new line, and then start the vm at it's old ip?)

could SETGLOBAL pop?

About the precedence of bitwise ops

idea:
I go for an ownership model. And the (unary) & operator gets the clone of an Rc.
And the + operator gets an actual clone of it.
