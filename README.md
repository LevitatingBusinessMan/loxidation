# Loxidation
This is my second implemention of Lox from the [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) book by Bob Nystrom. As opposed to my previous implementation [Rulox](https://github.com/LevitatingBusinessMan/rulox), which compiled and interpreted an AST, Loxdidation is a single-pass bytecode compiler.
